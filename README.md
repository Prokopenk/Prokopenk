Hello. I am a python developer and am currently looking for new opportunities.
I will once again join a close-knit team to work together on interesting projects.
Previous work experience taught me how to multitask, 
find innovative solutions and work in a team. I have completed courses in python development, 
I have knowledge of frameworks and continue to study everything related.
 My hard skills: Python, Django, Git, SQL, OOP.
 I will be glad to communicate and offer a job or an internship program.
